    <p1>A cartoon is a type of illustration, sometimes animated, typically in a non-realistic or semi-realistic style.
        The specific meaning has evolved over time, but the modern usage usually refers to either:
        an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor; or a motion picture that relies on a
        sequence of illustrations for its animation. Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a
        cartoonist,[1] and in the second sense they are usually called an animator.</p1>

<p class="fig"> A cartoon (from Italian: cartone and Dutch: kartonâ€”words describing strong, heavy paper or pasteboard)
    is a full-size drawing made on sturdy paper as a design or modello for a painting, stained glass, or tapestry.<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/V%26A_-_Raphael%2C_Christ%27s_Charge_to_Peter_%281515%29.jpg/220px-V%26A_-_Raphael%2C_Christ%27s_Charge_to_Peter_%281515%29.jpg" width="500" alt=""></p>

<p>In print media, a cartoon is an illustration or series of illustrations, usually humorous in intent. This usage dates
    from 1843, when Punch magazine applied the term to satirical drawings in its pages,[5] particularly sketches by John Leech.</p>

<p>Political cartoons are like illustrated editorial that serve visual commentaries on political events. They offer subtle
    criticism which are cleverly quoted with humour and satire to the extent that the criticized does not get embittered.</p>
<h3><li id="xc">Scientific</li></h3>
<p>Cartoons such as xkcd have also found their place in the world of science, mathematics, and technology. For example,
    the cartoon Wonderlab looked at daily life in the chemistry lab. In the U.S., one well-known cartoonist for these fields is Sidney Harris. Many of Gary Larson's cartoons have a scientific flavor.</p>
<h3><li id="cv">Comic books</li></h3>
<p>Books with cartoons are usually magazine-format "comic books," or occasionally reprints of newspaper cartoons.</p>

<p>Because of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early animated movies, cartoon came to refer to
    animation, and the word cartoon is currently used in reference to both animated cartoons and gag cartoons</p>
